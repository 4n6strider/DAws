###About

There's multiple things that makes DAws better than every Web Shell out there:

1. Bypasses Disablers; DAws isn't just about using a particular function to get the job done, it uses up to 6 functions if needed, for example, if shell_exec was disabled it would automatically use exec or passthru or system or popen or proc_open instead, same for Downloading a File from a Link, if Curl was disabled then file_get_content is used instead and this Feature is widely used in every section and fucntion of the shell.
1. Multi Handler. Can handle multiple connections all at once.
1. Bridge. Plays also the roll of a Bridge between the Clients and the Controller.
1. The Controller’s connection requires a plain text password, it’s not the best but it’s more than enough when it comes to keeping “l337 hax0rz b0t tak30v3r” away.
1. Accepts only 1 Controller at a time.
1. Kicks the Controller after 10 mins. This was added just in case someone forgot his Controller on which won’t allow other controllers to connect (since the Server only accepts 1 controller at a time).
1. Uses a very small amount of CPU and RAM when running.
1. Fast and Stable.
